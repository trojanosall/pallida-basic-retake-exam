# EXAM: Programming Basics

### Getting Started
 - Fork this repository under your own account
 - Clone the forked repository to your computer
 - Create a `.gitignore` file so generated files won't be committed
 - Commit your progress frequently and with descriptive commit messages
 - All your answers and solutions should go in this repository

### What can I use?
- You can use any resource online, but **please work individually**
- **Don't just copy-paste** your answers and solutions, use your own words instead.
- **Don't push your work** to GitHub until your mentor announces that the time is up


# Tasks
## 1-3. Complete the following tasks:
- [Count characters](countchars/CountChars.cs)

- [PokeBag](pokebag/PokeBag.cs)

### Acceptance criteria
The application is accepted if:
- The solution works according to specification [1p each]
- The solution follows [styleguide](https://github.com/greenfox-academy/teaching-materials/blob/master/styleguide/cs.md) [1p]
- Has proper error handling where the specification says it [1p each]
- Has the correct loops, methods, filters [1p each]

- You commit frequently with descriptive commit messages [1p]

## 4. Question time! (~10 mins) [4p]

###  What is inheritance? When would you use it? [2p]
#### Your answer:
[We use inherintance wit related to class in C#. The inheritance provide us possibility to determine a class in terms of another class. It makes easier to create and maintain the program. The inheritance also gives an opportunity to reuse the code functionality and speeds up implementation time.Inheritance is important base of object-oriented programming. We separate two group: Base calss - the class whose members are inherited, Derived class: that inherits from base class. We use inheritance when we wants to use some part of the base class in the derived class.]


### Name each building block of a method! [2p]

#### Your answer:
[1: Method signature   
2: Return value type  
3: Method name  
4: Type of the method parameters  
5: Name of the method parameters  
6: Method arguments  
7: Block of statements  
8: REturn value
